# Collatz-Conjecture
Program demonstrating the Collatz Conjecture, also known as the $3n+1$ conjecture, or the **hailstone sequence**

This program displays the number of steps required for the sequence to terminate (whenever it reaches 1), regardless of whatever number we start at. The program is set to display a range of starting numbers, from 1 to n which is defined by user.
